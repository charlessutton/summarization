      "QUICK TRIP ON FRENCH TGV HAS O.C. PANEL UP TO SPEED.\n",
      "Racing through the verdant French countryside toward Rennes Saturday, Orange \n",
      "County Supervisor Don R. Roth got to fulfill a fantasy -- announcing the \n",
      "blistering speed of 186 m.p.h. to several hundred passengers aboard France's \n",
      "TGV, the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse. \n",
      "He was thrilled. \n",
      "\"This is one of the greatest experiences of my life,\" Roth announced over the \n",
      "train's intercom. \n",
      "The French National Railroad, which wants to build and operate a similar rail \n",
      "line between Las Vegas and Anaheim, had found a way to top its competition, the \n",
      "West Germans. It let Roth sit in the cab next to the engineer. \n",
      "And Roth is a key person to impress because he is the vice chairman of the \n",
      "California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, the panel that hopes to make a \n",
      "final decision later this year about which kind of train to pick. \n",
      "Roth and eight other members of the 16-person commission rode the French train \n",
      "in shifts Friday and Saturday as part of a 10-day \"technology tour\" aimed at \n",
      "examining the French and German competitors up close. On Wednesday, they rode \n",
      "West Germany's magnetically levitated high-speed train. \n",
      "The commission is paying $20,000 for members' expenses on the tour, but spouses \n",
      "and an entourage of 25 Orange County business executives and their spouses have \n",
      "paid their own way. \n",
      "Saturday's 233-mile jaunt took only two hours and four minutes. According to \n",
      "the Orange County passengers, the experience made Amtrak look like a throwback \n",
      "to the age of steam locomotives. \n",
      "Still, there were mixed reactions. \n",
      "\"It just glides out,\" said Brian Pearson, manager of planning and projects \n",
      "development for the Orange County Transit District. \"It was the most pleasant \n",
      "train ride I've ever had by a long shot.\" \n",
      "\"It's smoother than a limo,\" said Robert Carley, senior vice president of \n",
      "Robert Bein, Wm. Frost &amp; Associates, an Irvine engineering firm. \n",
      "While the train was proceeding on new tracks designed for high-speed service, \n",
      "there were lots of oohs and ahs among the American visitors. But then the train \n",
      "hit a large section of old track, and swaying increased dramatically. \n",
      "\"I'm getting queasy,\" said Jim Erickson, a lawyer from San Juan Capistrano. \n",
      "\"On the maglev I felt more secure,\" said Aram Keith, president of Costa \n",
      "Mesa-based Keith Engineering, referring to the German train. \n",
      "The French train's coaches are narrower than those used for the maglev vehicle \n",
      "in Germany but they are much heavier. \n",
      "\"It's hard to compare the two,\" said Buck Johns, a Newport Beach real estate \n",
      "investor who has purchased land near the proposed Las Vegas-Anaheim train \n",
      "route. \"Maglev was on a test track and this is in the real world . . . but I \n",
      "think I prefer the maglev ride because it was smoother.\" \n",
      "\"Both of them are state-of-the-art as far as moving people is concerned,\" Roth \n",
      "added. \"On the new track, the French train gives maglev a very good run for the \n",
      "money.\" \n",
      "That's what French National Railroad officials wanted to hear him say, because \n",
      "until then Roth had been leaning strongly toward the maglev. \n",
      "After a separate trip on Friday, commission members Nick Horn of Nevada and \n",
      "Angie Papadakis of California also praised the French train. \n",
      "But Horn said he was concerned about a briefing that he attended with other \n",
      "commission members during which French railroad officials failed to answer some \n",
      "key questions to his satisfaction. He raised such issues as the French train's \n",
      "inability to handle steep grades in mountainous terrain, financing difficulties \n",
      "and the lack of a specific manufacturing schedule if France wins the \n",
      "competition. \n",
      "\"I asked them where we were on their priority list, and I never did get a \n",
      "straight answer,\" Horn said. \n",
      "Meanwhile, Papadakis praised the French train as \"very luxurious\" and said it \n",
      "provided a \"wonderful\" ride. \n",
      "\"I can just see that if everyone in America could experience this ride, they \n",
      "would love trains. I think there is room for both the French and German \n",
      "technologies in America,\" she said. \n",
      "French officials argue that their train has a proven record of carrying \n",
      "millions of passengers each year at a profit while the West Germans still have \n",
      "their maglev confined to a test track. \n",
      "They also have statistics showing that their train has reduced the growth in \n",
      "automobile traffic on parallel French highways and has cut in half the number \n",
      "of passengers using airlines along the same corridors, thus reducing the need \n",
      "for service at crowded airports. \n",
      "There are 105 French high-speed trains in service on several routes, all built \n",
      "on time and on budget, according to French officials. \n",
      "But such success does not come easily. French wine makers continue to object to \n",
      "high-speed trains cutting across their fields, with some arguing that the \n",
      "trains' vibrations harm their vineyards. \n",
      "French officials have studied the vibration problem and have even tunneled \n",
      "under one vineyard, but the farmer involved is still not satisfied, officials \n",
      "said. Also, France's activist Green Party, which concerns itself with the \n",
      "environment, has become more worrisome and bothersome, said Claude Constant, \n",
      "director of international cooperation for the French National Railroad. \n",
      "In one case, for example, the Green Party forced the railroad to relocate a \n",
      "pond to protect frogs. \n",
      "And the Green Party, along with a group of homeowners near St. Arnoult \n",
      "Enyvelines, outside Paris, forced officials to construct a concrete sound wall \n",
      "next to the tracks even though they had never objected to a much noisier, \n",
      "heavily congested highway closer to their homes. \n",
      "\"Everybody wants the train service,\" Constant said, \"but they say, 'Not in my \n",
      "garden.' \" \n",
      "French officials say their high-speed model is quieter at 270 m.p.h. than a \n",
      "conventional train is at 100 m.p.h. \n",
      "But there are some who are skeptical, possibly including Roth. \n",
      "\"It remains to be seen,\" he said Saturday, \"whether the French train can \n",
      "survive the environmental problems it is likely to encounter in California.\" \n",
      "While the French train ride is more comfortable than that of a conventional \n",
      "train, some passengers -- even Parisians interviewed Saturday -- said they \n",
      "object to their ears \"popping\" every time the train goes through a tunnel at \n",
      "high speed. \n",
      "The problem is that the speeding train compresses the tunnel's air in front of \n",
      "it, changing the pressure in the inner ear. But others said it was no worse \n",
      "than the same popping experienced on an airplane. \n",
      "\"I take the train to Rennes almost every weekend,\" said Jean Amburgey, a banker \n",
      "whose fiance lives in Rennes, about 250 miles from Paris. \"I much prefer the \n",
      "train because it is so convenient.\" \n",
      "The fare is about $100 for a round trip. \n",
      "The French, however, are used to using trains. Within the Paris area, for \n",
      "example, about half the commuters use public transit, mostly trains, including \n",
      "the Paris Metro. The commuter rail service is so cheap -- less than $1 per day \n",
      "for unlimited use -- it is virtually free by American standards. \n",
      "Said Paris transit spokesman Cyrille de La Faye: \"In Paris, a politician who \n",
      "doesn't work for better public transport will lose his job.\" \n",
      "Facts About The TGV \n",
      "The TGV is a high-speed train made by the French firm GEM Alsthom. It can reach \n",
      "speeds of nearly 300 m.p.h. and has carried more than 100 million passengers \n",
      "since entering service n 1981. The main TGV line runs between Paris and Lyon. \n",
      "Additional lines in other parts of France are now being added. \n",
      "Pros \n",
      "-The TGV has a proven track record in commerical service. \n",
      "-It is non-polluting. \n",
      "-Capital costs are less than West German's experimental magnetic-levitation \n",
      "train system. \n",
      "Cons \n",
      "-TGV cannot take steep grades. \n",
      "-It uses more energy than the maglev train. \n",
      "-It requires extensive earth removal for tracks to be laid. \n",
      "The steel-wheel train, which runs on electicity, can travel on conventional \n",
      "railroad tracks. \n",
      "TGV stands for Train a Grande Vitesse, or high-speed train. \n",
      "In order to keep the train stable at high rates of speed, the traction motors \n",
      "are suspended from the chassis, reducing strain on the tracks. TGV is also \n",
      "equipped with three different brake systems that allow the train to stop at \n",
      "high speeds. \n",
      "PANEL KEEPS LAS VEGAS-TO-ANAHEIM SUPER-SPEED TRAIN ON TRACK.\n",
      "The bistate commission working to link Las Vegas and Anaheim with a super-speed \n",
      "train voted Saturday to proceed with plans to build the $4-billion project. \n",
      "The California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission voted 16 to 1 to continue \n",
      "the project-planning process and to call for proposals to build the 300-m.p.h. \n",
      "futuristic train. \n",
      "Ontario, Calif. Mayor Howard Snider cast the only dissenting vote. \n",
      "Snider said he feared a super-speed train station near his city would add to \n",
      "traffic congestion and pollution in the Orange County area. \n",
      "He said his vote reflects the fact that his concerns have not been answered by \n",
      "the commission, its consultants and Transrapid -- a West German super-speed \n",
      "train developer. \n",
      "Transrapid appears to be the only company willing to privately build, finance \n",
      "and operate the magnetically levitated train, said the Ontario mayor. \n",
      "\"We really have only one potential bidder,\" Snider said. \"To go ahead with a \n",
      "mag-lev train with one bidder in there, I think they're going to be calling all \n",
      "the shots. I don't think it's right.\" \n",
      "However, Las Vegas City Councilman Arnie Adamsen, who chairs the commission, \n",
      "disagreed and said Transrapid will not dictate to the commission. \"It's going \n",
      "to be a cooperative effort,\" Adamsen said. \n",
      "He said other companies interested in building the train can register with the \n",
      "commission between Jan. 3 and Jan. 24, the registration deadline commissioners \n",
      "set Saturday for companies planning to seek the train franchise. \n",
      "Adamsen said a French company, TGW, which has developed a conventional style \n",
      "train that carries passengers at speeds up to 170 m.p.h., has not dropped out \n",
      "of the running. \n",
      "However, the French company was not represented at Saturday's meeting. \n",
      "At its October meeting, the commission selected Anaheim, 27 miles from downtown \n",
      "Los Angeles, as the California terminus for the proposed train. The board also \n",
      "decided to ask the company eventually chosen to build the train to consider \n",
      "running a spur from Victorville to Palmdale. \n",
      "Los Angeles officials have pushed recently for a station in Palmdale because \n",
      "the city is building a reliever airport in the rapidly growing community \n",
      "located in the northern portion of the San Fernando Valley. \n",
      "The Anaheim station likely would be built near Anaheim Stadium. Orange County \n",
      "Supervisor Don R. Roth, a former Anaheim mayor, has suggested a 17.4-acre site \n",
      "next to the existing Amtrak station and behind the stadium for a high-speed \n",
      "train terminal. The site is now used by county flood-control officials and has \n",
      "a county maintenance and repair shop. \n",
      "When Anaheim was selected as the terminus in October, Roth predicted that the \n",
      "rail system would be \"a big boost for our tourism industry, and more \n",
      "importantly . . . a financially sound system.\" \n",
      "A consultant hired to study possible routes has estimated that an Anaheim-Las \n",
      "Vegas line, also stopping in Ontario, would draw 6.5 million round-trip \n",
      "passengers annually. \n",
      "By contrast, a line between the northern San Fernando Valley and Las Vegas, \n",
      "stopping in Palmdale, would draw only 2.3 million passengers, the consultant \n",
      "said. \n",
      "The consultant also predicted that while the super train would create between \n",
      "24,000 and 53,000 jobs, up to 47% of them in Southern California, auto traffic \n",
      "on the streets near the Anaheim station would jump from 9,700 trips on most \n",
      "days up to 31,000 trips on \"peak Sundays.\" \n",
      "However, that increase in pollution could be offset a commuters using the super \n",
      "train instead of their cars to travel between the cities. \n",
      "Las Vegas officials estimate that about 60% of the city's visitors come from \n",
      "Southern California. \n",
